## Work with problems

- look at `src/example.py` - this is an example of little solution. Here we use decorators for measure run time of code. Code of decorators contains in `src/util/`
- work in you own folder to solve problems `src/<your folder name>`. Use name of function in LeetCode task as name of python file where you test a solution
- pls use decorators to measure times
- check code style by run `flake8 src/<your folder name>` before any commit
- create you own branch and commit to that branch. You cant commit directly to main. If your solution is ready - make pull request to main from your branch. Review no needed - merge it by itself. Dont forget fetch and pull before and after.
